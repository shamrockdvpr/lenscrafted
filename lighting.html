				<h3>Exposure</h3>
				<p>The main aspect to a good photo is proper exposure. Exposure is controlled using the three main settings, ISO, Shutter Speed and Aperature. If a photo is underexposed, increasing shutter speed may work, or increasing ISO, or creating a larger aperature. However each setting has drawbacks.</p>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Shutter Speed</dt>
					<dd>There are a few drawbacks to increasing or decreasing shutter speed. A high shutter speed may not let enough light in and can make motion apear frozen, which may not be the look you are going for. Conversly a low shutter speed needs a tripod or stable shooting surface to prevent excessive blur.<dd>
					
					<dt>Aperature</dt>
					<dd>Aperature also creates a depth of field effect. A low aperature may let less light in but also creates an infinite depth of field, which can be detrimental to the photo layout. On the other hand, a high aperature creates a shallow depth of field which may not be the look you are going for.<dd>
					
					<dt>ISO</dt>
					<dd>A higher or lower ISO allows more freedom with the other settings but using a high ISO can result in very grainy photos. And using a low ISO can make a photo much too underexposed or require very high settings from the other two to make it work.<dd>
				</dl>
				
				<p>These three settings form what is known as the Exposure Triangle. To properly expose a photo, a good balance of all three is required.
